<h2>Build & Cert process overview</h2>
<ol>
 <li>Purchase your kit</li>
 <li>Find a certifier and tell them what you are upto, book in for first check. [Certifer List](http://www.lvvta.org.nz/documents/suplementary_information/CertifierList-Website.pdf) You will need a 1D rated certifier.</li>
 <li>Get as much done pre coating the chassis (certifier required to inspect chassis pre coating)</li>
 <li>Take what ever you have to the certifier, discuss any concerns you have, take note of what he has to say. (aprx $200)</li>
 <li>Strip the car and send for powder coating/painting.</li>
 <li>Re-assemble everything, as the Exocet is fairly exposed, no intermediate inspection is normally required.</li>
