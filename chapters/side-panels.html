			<li>Hold the plastic sheet to the edge of the chassis, mark and rough cut off the excess length leaving 10-20mm each end. Remember, protective plastic coating is on the outside.</li>
			<li>Clamp the piece to the chassis so that the rear end is square, and the plastic is touching somewhere on the main rail.</li>
			<li>Using something of sufficient width to bridge the largest gap between the plastic and main rail, draw a line parallel to the main rail, this will be slightly curved.</li>
			<li>Remove and cut this line, a sharp knife should be sufficient. </li>
			<li>Refit with clamps, check for snug fit along main rail, remove and adjust if required.</li>
			<li>draw a line around the chassis on the plastic </li>
			<li>Remove and cut the final line. </li>
			<li>Repaeat for the other side, note, they are both slightly different so dont make a exact copy</li>
