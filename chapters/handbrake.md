Handbrake
===

1.	Refit handbrake cables if removed from the rear subframe.
2.	The cables require a sharp bend, close to their maximum so take care threading the cables between the subframe and chassis and out on the passenger side above the trans tunnel.
3.	Drill a 2mm hole centrally vertically and just to the outside of the cable holes for the return spring.
4.	Thread the cables to the mounting points on the rear trans. tunnel section, they may need enlarging slightly. 
5.	The driver's side cable is slightly short so a modification is required to the trans tunnel. Either; 
a.	Cut 2 slots and bend the steel to form a round surface for the cable to rest on.
b.	Cut out a notch for the cable and use edging strip to protect the cable.
6.	Clip the cable in place using the original spring clips.
7.	Fit the 2-1 cable adapter and the handbrake assy. to the other end of the cable.
8.	Tighten the adjustment nut to about 10mm on
9.	Position the handbrake assy. so the handle is as level as possible with a tight cable.
10.	Mark and drill the holes, M10x25 on the rear and 2 M8x35 on the front, make up a spacer 5-8mm thick to hold the handbrake parallel to the tunnel. Use a washer and nyloc on all bolts.
11.	Loosen the adjustment nut and fit the assy. 
12.	Re-tighten the adjustment and check operation.
13.	Find a suitable point to utilise the cable brackets to help secure to the chassis. Remember the hubs move and some slack will be required.
14.	Remove all handbrake parts.
