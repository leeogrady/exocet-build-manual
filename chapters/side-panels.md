Side Panels

1.	Hold the plastic sheet to the edge of the chassis, mark and rough cut off the excess length leaving 10-20mm each end. Remember, protective plastic coating is on the outside.
2.	Clamp the piece to the chassis so that the rear end is square, and the plastic is touching somewhere on the main rail.
3.	Using something of sufficient width to bridge the largest gap between the plastic and main rail, draw a line parallel to the main rail, this will be slightly curved.
4.	Remove and cut this line, a sharp knife should be sufficient. 
5.	Refit with clamps, check for snug fit along main rail, remove and adjust if required.
6.	draw a line around the chassis on the plastic 
7.	Remove and cut the final line. 
8.	Repaeat for the other side, note, they are both slightly different so dont make a exact copy
