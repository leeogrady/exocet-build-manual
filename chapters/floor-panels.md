Floor panels
=== 

1.	Place the large aluminium sheet on the underside of the chassis and trace around
2.	Cut the Panels. Note they are not the same so trace each one.
3.	Running a file and a bit of 200grit sand paper over the edges will save you from cutting yourself when handling and improve the finished look
